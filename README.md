<h1><a id="Aline_3"></a>Aline</h1>
<p>Aline is a space recognition and positioning system designed for robotic manipulators.</p>
<h1><a id="Features_7"></a>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Module design</li>
<li>Easy-to-use</li>
<li>Fully open-source</li>
</ul>
<p>Aline is built on a modular structure that allows you to use only the necessary parts of the code. User-friendly documentation allows you to develop scripts based on existing Aline libraries.<br>
We tried to create a multifunctional tool to simplify the work with complex equipment.</p>
